/dev/nall's dotfiles
====================

A bunch of dotfiles for my environment, including:

* zsh

* vim

* tmux

* BASH (deprecated)

* screen (deprecated)

These are a work in progress (and likely always will be) and are in dire need of a cleanup.

The (deprecated) stuff isn't really being used in my current environment but I'm keeping it around in case I end up on an old box without the new hotness.

Requirements
------------

For vim to work, first install Vundle:

`git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle`
